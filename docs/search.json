    "text": "About the App\nWHS Handicap Calculator is an all-in-one golf handicap calculator app for calculating WHS handicaps for all popular formats of play. It includes the 2024 changes, applicable in GB&I from April 2024.\n\nThis app provides the Course and Playing Handicaps under the World Handicap System for individual and team formats. The calculations are based on the WHS Rules of Handicapping and Guidance documents. The recommended Handicap Allowances are applied for all the formats and the relevant adjustments are added to the Playing Handicaps whenever multiple tees are selected.\n\nThis app caters for all golfers with a WHS Handicap Index, including plus-handicap golfers. The app includes various settings for use in multiple countries.\n\nUsing the App\n\nCreate and manage a custom list of courses by adding the Course Rating, Slope Rating and Par for tees on any 18-hole or 9-hole course. Users may also add from a list of courses available on the app. The data for these courses have been primarily sourced from the USGA Course Rating and Slope Database. Users are recommended to check that the ratings and pars used in the calculations are current and update/edit as necessary to maintain accuracy of the calculations.\n\nThe Single tab may be used for up to 12 players when all play off the same tee. The handicaps may be further adjusted for a different tee used in a wider competition, for example for a single-tee team in a mixed competition.\nThe Mixed tab may be used for up to 4 players when more than one tee is used.\n\nSelect a course, tee(s) and playing format from drop-down lists. Enter multiple Handicap Indexes between -10.0 and 54.0 separated by space or comma. Handicap Indexes outside of this range are discarded. Tees are assigned to the players and grouped into teams in the order of the Handicap Indexes entered. Playing Handicaps for Teams are given against the last player on each team. For a plus-handicap golfer enter the Handicap Index as a negative value.\nFor Foursomes, Greensomes and Scramble formats where the par of the scoring tee is used to adjust the Course Handicaps, the tee with the highest par is used by default. Alternatively, a different scoring tee may be used by assigning it to the first player in the Mixed tab or the adjustment tee in the Single tab.\nThe Playing Handicaps are provided only when each Handicap Index has an assigned tee and the minimum number of Handicap Indexes for the selected format have been entered. This is to ensure that the correct mixed-tee adjustments are applied to the PH.\n\nApply the relevant and custom settings for the calculations. Share handicaps easily with others.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFor any questions or comments, please contact whs.calculator@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed 4BBB Stroke play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed 4BBB Match play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Greensomes Stroke play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Greensomes Match play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed 4 Player Scramble\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Foursomes Match play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreensomes Stroke play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Custom Courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Clubs from List\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "The calculation for 4BBB match play was changed in 2024. The handicap allowance of 90% is no longer applied to the Course Handicaps but to the difference in Playing Handicaps instead. Previously, the 90% allowance was applied to the Course Handicap and strokes based on full difference to the lowest Playing Handicap.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Index] --&gt; B(CH) --&gt; C([x 90%]):::foobar --&gt; D([+ adjustment])\n  D --&gt; E(PH) --&gt; F(Difference)\n  G(lowest PH) --&gt; F(Difference)\n  \n    classDef foobar fill:#f96\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing this change, the players now receive strokes based on 90% of the difference in their Playing Handicaps to the lowest Playing Handicap.

In some cases, there may be a difference in one stroke when the 90% is applied to the difference in PH instead.\n\nThe PH of all players are rounded before taking the difference to the lowest PH. Since any par adjustments are whole numbers, the CH is effectively rounded in the new calculation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The changes in 2024 in the WHS introduced a ‘scoring tee’ for calculating Course and Playing Handicaps for Foursomes, Greensomes and Scramble formats.\nPreviously, any adjustments for multiple tees for these formats were done after applying Handicap Allowance to the Course Handicap.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Index] --&gt; B(CH) --&gt; C([x Allowance])\n  C --&gt; D([+ adjustment]):::foobar --&gt; E(PH)\n  \n    classDef foobar fill:#f96\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of selecting a scoring tee for calculating Playing Handicaps in the above team formats is simply to bring the mixed-tee par adjustment forward by applying it to Course Handicaps instead. The Course Handicaps of all players are recalculated based on a common par used by all the players, i.e the par of the scoring tee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Index] --&gt; C(Adjusted CH)\n  B([Par of scoring tee]):::foobar --&gt; C(Adjusted CH):::foobar \n  C --&gt; D([x Allowance]) --&gt; E(PH)\n      classDef foobar fill:#f96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome implications of Adjusting Course Handicaps\nIt simplifies the calculations as no further adjustments are needed. The Course Handicap now includes CR-Par and hence any adjustments for multiple tees is needed only for some formats and if there is a difference in pars in the tees. Therefore, if all tees have the same par, the choice of scoring tee will not affect the Course or the Playing Handicaps.\nThe Handicap Allowance is now also applied to the mixed-tee adjustments. This means that adjustments for individual players on the team may be different and the total adjustment for a team may even be smaller than before. For example, the adjustment for a mixed 4-player scramble team is now 70% of the adjustment we had prior to the 2024 changes.\n\nEffect of Scoring Tee\n\nThe strong recommendation from England Golf is to use the forward tee for scoring in mixed or any-mix team competitions of alternate-shot or scramble formats. This is often the ladies’ tee and the one with the highest par. There are certain advantages to using the forward tee for scoring in mixed competitions.\n\nFor mixed match play, the choice of the scoring tee is an important consideration when the stroke indexes of the tees are different. However, it has NO effect on the strokes in a foursomes or greensomes match. Changing the scoring tee will simply result in the PH of both teams either being increased or decreased by exactly the same amount. Therefore, any such change in the team PH due to the choice of the scoring tee will cancel out when determining the strokes in a match.\n\nSimilarly, the choice of the scoring tee for medal scoring will have no effect on the standings in a competition as the PH of all teams will either increase or decrease by the same amount.\n\nHowever, the choice of the scoring tee for stableford scoring may have a different relative effect on teams. For example, changing the scoring tee for two teams with PH of 1 and 31 may increase the strokes by 3 to give PH of 4 and 34. The lower handicap team will be more likely to benefit from the 3 extra strokes than the higher handicap team."

It provides the Course and Playing Handicaps that include all mixed tee adjustments for all popular individual and team formats.

The adjusted Playing Handicaps are labeled with an s (stableford) and m (medal or matchplay) and are provided only when each handicap index has an assigned tee.\nMixed-tee adjustments\nFor individual and team competitions played from mixed or multiple tees, adjustments to the Course or Playing Handicaps are made to achieve equity when the CR and/or par for the tees are different. These adjustments depend on the method of calculating CH, the format and scoring method.\nIn this app, any mixed tee adjustments are applied by adding strokes against the selected tee with the lowest rating measures. These adjustments may therefore differ if an unselected tee with lower ratings were also used and/or a different method of adjustment was applied.\nWhen the Course Handicap includes CR-Par, the stableford points to play to handicap are equal across all the tees. Hence any further adjustments are not required for individual stableford using own card. Adjustments for medal scoring are based on difference in pars.\n\n\n\nAlong with including CR-Par in the Course Handicap calculation, there are some other changes to the handicap calculations.\nFor 4BBB matchplay, the 90% allowance is applied to the difference in rounded Course Handicaps. For foursomes matchplay, the 50% allowance is applied to the difference in combined Course Handicaps.\nFor mixed team formats such as greensomes, foursomes and scramble, it is assumed that all teams score from the tee with the highest par and the Course Handicaps are adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please contact us at whs.calculator@gmail.com"
